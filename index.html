    <!-- About Me Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I serve in the United States Air Force as a Water and Fuels Systems Maintenance technician. I’ve always been passionate about motorcycles, computers, and hands-on work. When I'm not maintaining infrastructure, I spend time riding, upgrading bikes, and learning more about web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m pursuing a career in IT and plan to use my skills from both the military and this program to build something meaningful. My long-term goal is to run my own business, combining technical knowledge with real-world experience in mechanical repair and digital design.

        <p>
            I plan to expand this webpage by adding a contact form, integrating a services request form, and including a detailed portfolio section. Eventually, I will incorporate CSS to improve the visual layout and responsiveness across all screen sizes.
